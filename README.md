A python script that modifies the inputted image with the keybinds in the comment at the top.

# Features:
  * increase and decrease intensity of each color RGB
  * sharpen
  * blur/painterly
  * grayscale
  * some type of sorting

This is a really old script I made to try to recreate common image effects I saw without searching up the solutions.
